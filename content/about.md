I am cybersecurity expert experienced in driving connected product security development and certification. I am also an active contributor to the standardization of product security at [CEN-CENELEC](<https://www.cencenelec.eu/>), [CSA](<https://csa-iot.org/>) and [ITU](<https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx>).


## Expertise {#expertise}

My professional career has spanned twenty-plus years in the field of connected product development with strong focus on product security. My expertise includes:

-   Cybersecurity standardization and certification
-   Operational (OT) and Information (IT) technology product security including integration between OT and IT
-   Communication protocols: Zigbee, Matter, LiFi, WiFi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, NFC, …
-   Smart cards, secure elements and Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) based solutions
-   Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) based solutions


## Regulations {#regulations}

Cybersecurity regulations driven by EU, but also the governments in other regions of the world, impose many obligations that have to be fulfilled by a manufacturer of internet connected products across majority of the markets. These obligations are related to the product cybersecurity but also to the processes used to develop and maintain the products over their life time.

Having being involved in the ongoing standardization work related to the Radio Equipment Directive and the Cyber Resilience Act at [CEN-CENELEC](<https://www.cencenelec.eu/areas-of-work/cenelec-sectors/digital-society-cenelec/cybersecurity-and-data-protection/>) but also Connectivity Standards Alliance [Product Security Certification Program](<https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/global-approach-to-iot-cybersecurity/>) addressing worldwide regulations, I can bring important insights that can help guide product development to improve security and achieve compliance with cybersecurity regulations.


## Standards {#standards}

I’m currently contributing to the development of Cyber Resilience Act related standards and have contributed to a number of standards in the past:

-   [RED DA standards](<https://www.cencenelec.eu/news-events/news/2025/newsletter/ots-59-cybersecurity-standards/>): EN 18031-1/2/3:2024
-   [Zigbee Direct](<https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/zigbee/zigbee-direct/>)
-   [LiFi ITU standard](<https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.9991/en>)
-   [Fairhair Specification](<https://openconnectivity.org/developer/specifications/fairhair/>)
