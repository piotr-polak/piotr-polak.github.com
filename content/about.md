I am cybersecurity expert experienced in driving connected product security development and certification. I am also an active contributor to the standardization of product security at [CEN-CENELEC](<https://www.cencenelec.eu/>), [CSA](<https://csa-iot.org/>) and [ITU](<https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx>).


## Expertise {#expertise}

My professional career has spanned twenty-plus years in the field of connected product development with strong focus on product security. My expertise includes:

-   Cybersecurity standardization and certification: RED DA, CRA, EN IEC 62443, EN 303645, ...
-   Operational (OT) and Information (IT) technology product security including integration between OT and IT
-   Network access control: 802.1x, 802.11i
-   Wireless protocols: Zigbee, Matter, LiFi, WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC
-   Smart cards, secure elements and Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) based solutions
-   Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) based solutions


## Standards {#standards}

I’m currently contributing to the development of Cyber Resilience Act related standards at CEN-CENELEC and ETSI. I have contributed to a number of standards in the past:

-   [RED DA standards](<https://www.cencenelec.eu/news-events/news/2025/newsletter/ots-59-cybersecurity-standards/>): EN 18031-1/2/3:2024
